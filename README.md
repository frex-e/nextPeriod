# nextPeriod
A script to calculate time to next period, made for use on polybar

### Configuration

```python
FORMAT = "{hours}:{minutes}"
# Use {days}, {hours}, {minutes}, {seconds}

SLEEPMSG = "zzz"
```
#### Custom Timetable
To  edit the timetable, change the values in the periods list. Each sublist represents a day, with periods[0] representing Monday, and periods[6] representing Sunday.
